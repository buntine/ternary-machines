TERNARY COMPUTER
  - A ternary computer is a computer that uses Ternary logic (three values) instead of Binary logic (two values).
  - One early calculating machine built by Thomas Fowler operated in balanced ternary.
  - The first modern, electronic ternary computer was the Setun, developed in 1958 in the Soviet Union by Niklay Brusentsov.
  - Some operations (such as representing negative decimals) is more efficient in ternany machines.
  - Ternary computers may appear in the future via:
    - Combining an optical computer with the ternary logic system using fiber-optics.
    - A Josephson Junction using circulating superconducting currents, either clockwise, counterclockwise, or off.

BALANCED TERNARY
  - In unbalanced ternary, each digit has one of 3 values: 0, 1 or 2.
  - In balanced ternary, each digit has one of 3 values: −1, 0, or +1; these values may also be simplified to −, 0, +, respectively.
  - Balanced ternary has several advantages over the ubiquitous binary notation:
    - The Plus-Minus consistency cuts down on the number of carries in multiple-digit multiplication.
    - The Rounding-Truncation equivalence cuts down on the number of carries in rounding on fractions.
    - Native support for ternary operations such as less-equal-greater.
    - Represent all integers without needing to worry about a separate bit for the minus sign in negative integers.
