THE MYSTERIOUS TERNARY COMPUTER

There are some things in technology that we just take as universal truths:

- Computers are just mindless machines that do what we tell them to do;
- All computable functions can be computed by a Universal Turing Machine;
- Computers only really understand the binary system of 1 and 0.

It's the last one that I want to focus on. This is because even though today it's effectively true, it has not always been the case.

Here is a fact: Computers use the binary system of 1 and 0 to perform calculations.

This just means that ...

It's also not always true!
