Most people know that computers store data using the binary number system. One of the main reasons for this can be found in the circuitry of modern computers, which are made up of billions of tiny transistors that can be either *on* (1) or *off* (0).

Such a design is so ubiquitous nowadays that it's hard to imagine that computers could operate in any other way. But, in Soviet Russia during the 1950s, they did. Enter *Setun*, a balanced ternary computer developed in 1958 by a small team led by Nikolay Brusentsov at the Moscow State University.

Ok, so before we continue talking any more about Brusentsov and Setun, let me explain a little bit about balanced ternary.

Ternary is a number system in which there are *three* possible values. In balanced termany, these three possibilities are *-1*, *0* and *+1*; these values are often simplified to simply *-*, *0* and *+*, respectively. The same rules apply to ternary as to any other numeral system: The right-most symbol, *R*, has it's own value and each successive symbol has it's value multiplied by *3* raised to the power of it's distance, *D* from *R*. For example:

+++-0 = (1 * 3^4) + (1 * 3^3) + (1 * 3^2) + (-1 * 3^1) + (0 * 3^0)
      = 81 + 27 + 9 + -3 + 0
      = 114
